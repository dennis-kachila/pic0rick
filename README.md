This work is based on three previous TAPR projects, [the echOmods project](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), the [un0rick project](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick), and the [lit3rick project]() - their boards are open hardware and software, developped with open-source elements as much as possible.
